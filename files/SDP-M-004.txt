M1: My name is Sikander Seemab and the topic which I’m going to research on is “Persuasion of Masses: Use of NLP in the Speeches of Pakistani and American Politicians”. NLP, it can be termed as Neuro Linguistic Programming and it is […] the way […] how we use the language to manipulate the mind of the audiences. I have chosen this topic because I was <r> interested in finding out what different <er> techniques the politicians they adopt to make the audiences stick to their places and do certain things […] I have […] observed the speeches of great speakers such as […] Adolf Hiltler <h> Hitler <er> Bhutto, Steve Jobs and Barrac Obama. And what I observed from their speeches that all of them they use similar kind of techniques and those techniques are termed under <r> NLP. They use first of all they use rapports. Rapport is a technique […] in which you go into the shoes of the audiences. You make them believe that you are from them. And then they introduce yet sets <r>. In yes sets they introduce some problems which are the core problems of the common masses. They use <er> these sets to make the audiences realize that they know their problems and then they use negative sets. Negative sets set is a term that they connate <er> connate certain negative term with the problems like inflation, terrorism and inflation was caused by the previous government. And then again after negative sets they provide the solution and suggestions as well. We when we come into the into power we will do this and we will do this. They use the term, pronoun, we. They make the audiences realize that alone they can not do anything. With the help of the audiences, they will be able to do certain things. They take the audiences in confidence that with their help they will be able to solve the problems. And later. […] <int: M2:<i>> framework sir, In order to analyze the speeches I have taken Milton’s model. Erickson Milton’s model which was <er> given in 1970’s. <er> The founders of NLP <er> Richard <er> Bandler and John. Brenror, he <er> they both observed the language of Milton. Milton was a <er> psycho-therapist and he used vague language when he was dealing with his clients. He used vague language just because he wanted them to come to the solution of their own problems not <er> he himself wanted to tell the solution. Both these <er> <h> <er> psychiatrist, they analyze these language patterns and they <r> modified it in a model which later become after his name Milton model. And they have given <er> twenty different patterns of language which is found if any speech of <er> certain person that person will be using NLP. And <er> in order to analyze these speeches, I have taken four speeches from four different politicians. <int: M2: Model? > Sir, in the model, there are certain patterns of language. Number one is mind read. They <r> make the audience realize that they know what’s there in their mind like the example is, I know that you believe. They make the audience realize that they know the things which they also know. Loss performity, they <r> talk about certain actions which <er> the doer of the action is not explicit explicitly stated like breathing is good for the effect means if you do this thing the effect will be this. There are <er> twenty like such patterns in which they has used vague language. They have not <h> <er>h straightforwardly stated the solution of the problem but they have left the solution to the audiences to comprehend the solution.
