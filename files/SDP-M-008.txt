M1: Aslam O Alikum Everyone! I’m Kashif Jamshaid MS scholar for 2015 and the topic of my research is “A Corpus Based Islamic Feminist Study of Shahraz’s ‘The Holy Woman’ and Durrani’s ‘Blasphemy’. Professor Dr.Wasima Shehzad is my supervisor. […] The outline of my presentation is, first of all I’ll introduce Islamic Feminism then statement of the problem, research objectives, research questions, significance of the study then research methodology. In research methodology I’ll describe theoretical framework, textual analysis, selected novels, rationale for selecting the novels. […] Islamic Feminism, The term Islamic feminism was first used by Nilufer Gole in 1991. She used this term in her book ‘Forbidden Moderns’. After that Mai Yamani <er> in 1996, she used the term in ‘Feminism and Islam’. Then by the mid of 1990’s, this term was quite famous and it was being used by many scholars from different countries. Then what Islamic Feminists say, they believe that the Holy Quran assures that equality of all human beings regardless of their gender. […] As the Tonnessen, an islamic feminist, from <er> Sudan University, she quotes in her paper on Islamic feminism the words of Asma Barlas, she is a Pakistani American <er> Pakistani American feminist. She says, “I came to the realization that women and men are equal as a result, not of reading feminist texts, but of reading the Quran”. Then why <er> in Muslim countries women are not enjoying this equality. <er> The Islamic feminists they believe that the equality between men and women is obstructed by patriarchal influence and concepts. And to support this patriarchy or patriarchal culture <er> people use unreliable or weak Hadiths <er> against women. That is why Islamic feminists they <er> focus on or their major focus is on the text of the Holy Quran. Although they also conducted studies on <er> the Hadiths and Fiqah from gender perspective. These are the three major approaches used by the Islamic Feminists. <er> First of all their false stories that support <er> male superiority or male dominance. So, they revisited the verses of the Holy Quran to prove and to correct those stories. And then the second approach, there are the verses of the Holy Quran that describe the equality of men and women. <er> So they give references of those verses. And then <er> the third approach, there are verses of the Holy Quran that <er> basically show the difference but these verses were being used by <er> those who support patriarchy. They were using those verses to support patriarchal views or patriarchal culture. So, Islamic Feminists, they deconstruct or reevaluate those verses that <er> describe basically the difference. […] These are the three major approaches. […] <aah> Then statement of the problem, <er> the Western media and most of the Western literature have been biased about Islam and Muslims. Especially the representation of the Muslim women in the Western media and Western literature is soaked with their prejudice and biased attitude. And because of the dominance of the culture and traditions followed in the Muslim majority countries, the Muslim female image is misunderstood. So there is a need to differentiate between the culture, tradition and <er> religion and to present the true image of Muslim women. […] <er> These are the evidences. Patton, <er> she is the researcher. She conducted on, study on the representation of the Muslim women in the Western media and Western literature. She quotes the words of Hifah, a Western Muslim girl. She says, “Especially on women. She is talking about Muslim women. “Especially on women. They would think, “Oh my god, the poor Islamic woman, she’s gonna get an arranged marriage”, or “her husband’s gonna beat her five times a week. The media is spreading bad, different, you know, wrong images of Muslims, especially ladies”. So this, <er>, she continues and says that this is the bad image that <er> Western media and Western literature is presenting so it is our responsibility to present the true image of and we should tell them that we are allowed to get higher education and we are allowed to <er> go out of our homes. This is the second example. Alsultany, she also <er> she is talking about the Muslim women. <er> In her book she says, “… these women have been represented as veiled, oppressed, and in need of rescue. The government and the commercial news media have been central to the circulation of stories about the “oppressed Muslim Woman” <er> and the imperative to “save brown women from brown men”. These are the few examples of the representation of. So these are the research objectives: <ahh> to examine the issues faced by female characters portrayed in the novels from Islamic Feminist perspective. The second objective is to determine the similarities/ differences in the approach of native Pakistani and British Pakistani writers by evaluating similarities/ differences in the depiction of female figures in the novels selected for the current study. The third objective is, to compare the linguistic choices used for the representation of the female gender in the novels with <r> those for the women in the Holy Quran. […] Based upon these objectives, these are the research questions. First, how do the themes concerning women rights in The Holy Woman and Blasphemy conform and/ or contradict the Islamic feministic theory? The second questions is, how are female figures in both novels similar and different with reference to the Islamic feministic theory? The third question is, what types of lexical items have been used to represent the female characters in the selected novels and what role do they play in meaning making? <er> And the fourth question, how do lexical choices affect the feministic discourse infliction and the Holy Quran? […] This is the significance of the study. <er> This study is a contribution to the emerging field of Islamic feminism. It will also differentiate between stereotypes, patriarchal culture or traditions presented in the selected texts and religion […] and moreover, it will clarify Islamic stance on education for women <er>, education for women heritage rights, violence against women and marriage issues etc. […] So how I am going to conduct this study. This is the research methodology. <er> This is qualitative study. I’m going to use the theory of Islamic Feminism. <er> This thoery is based at <er>, upon the works of different scholars. Amina Wadud, Riffat Hassan, Fatima Naseef, they conducted studies on the text of the Holy Quran from gender perspective. Fatima Mernissi and Hidayet Tuksai, they conducted studies on Hadiths and Shaheen Sardar Ali and Aziza al-Hibri, they conducted studies on Islamic jurisprudence. <er> The works of these scholars are the base for <er> the analysis of the text and I’ve  <er> focus on the issues faced by female characters in these texts. […] The method of <er> is textual analysis. Then textual analysis focus on the text itself, <er> language choices, meanings, and other patterns <er>  in texts. And there are three types of textual approaches: genre analysis, corpus analysis and multimodal analysis. But in my study, I am going to use corpus analysis. In the current study, specifically the approach of corpus analysis by using corpus techniques and tools will be used to analyze the text. […] <ahh>  Then I <r>  will use the Corpus analysis to compare the lexical items used for female gender. Then what is corpus? Corpus refers to a collection of linguistic data, either written text or the transcription of recorded speech. <er> The corpus for the current study consists of the text of two novels and the translation of the Holy Quran. And then for Corpus Analysis, there are different <h> softwares that can be used but I am going to use AntConc software for Corpus Analysis. And after getting findings and results <er> from that software I will interpret the results and those findings. […] These are the novels that I have selected for my study. First, “The Holy Woman” <er> written by “Qaisra Shahraz”. The second one is “Blasphemy” by “Tehmina Durrani” […] Then why I have selected these novels <er> The protagonist in these <er>  novels are female characters and the gender issues have been highlighted in the novels, e.g., education for women, marriage, violence against women, freedom of choice, male superiority, and heritage issues. The backdrop of these novels is Pakistani society. As the religion of the characters is Islam, the novels directly deal with the Muslim Women issues and <er> moreover in these novels, religion has been exploited to support patriarchal culture against female rights. That’s why I have selected these novels. These are few references that I have used in my presentation. These are some of the references of working bibliography. […] Thank you!
