M1: Sir my topic is “Linguistic Stratification: An Analysis of Transgenders’ Identities and Ideologies”. Basically I want to <er> search their <r> <er>  identities that they display in the society. <er>  there are so many <er> theoretical boundaries <er>  which I would like to explain before I go ahead. <er> Transgender <er>  it.. <r> maintains that <er> gender is fluid, <er>  there <er>  sometimes gender is from male to female and from female to male and somewhere in between and sometimes both and sometimes none of them. <er>  it maintains that the <er> <h>  identity is socially find and forced and performed and bodied and self-constructed which are understandable through humanity. When all of these <er> combined together <er>  show that there are <er>  identities in their language. Now there identities are very complex because they are further tricked by race, ethnicity, class, age and location etc.[…] Now <er>  these <er>  <r> identities can easily be understood through using the communication theory of identity <er> that was given by Hecht. And he says that identity <er> its <r> inherently a communication process and must be understood as a transaction in which messages are and values are exchanged. <er>  it also says that identity is somethings <h>  there is an identity that a person <er> understands and there is another <r> identity that he enacts in the society. So there is sometimes difference between the real identity and the enacted identity and this is<h> very much with the <er> case of transgenders because they face stigma in shaming the society so they hide their<er> <h> identity. […]Now […] another theory which I would be using, the same theory one in my <er> framework as well, that these identity are located in personal […] enacted, relational in a community. And personal enacted and then these two different individuals <er> they of same identity come together and their identity becomes a memory the <er> memory of the society. Now Jung and Hect say that their identity <er>  remains a gap. Now this gap is due to the shame and the<er> problems they face in the society because the society is usually binary, male and female. So they use discursive strategies to find their position in the <er> <h> in the mainstream of society they try to come to the<er> mainstream of the society. And they do it by using different strategies like they use closed enactment, they use passing, disengagement, label changing and hyper engagement. They use all of these strategies. Goffman says they use control and management of information so they are not disclosed. They also use a degree of disclosure so that they<er><r> stride to be acceptable in the society, they try to push the boundaries of the society. They use verbal <h> reticence, they try to preserve <h> the <r> vocabulary which for them so that they are not understood. They also use misrepresentation. These all because of the shame that is associated to their gender that is in the society. Through the lense of all of these theories I want to look at the identities of transgender that how they are living in the society and <r>because of the shame what identities they are hiding and what identities they are showing which are actually not theirs caused by race ethnicity <h>or whatever. I also want to understand that whether they use English because one of my counters with the transgender <er>when I was talking to a He-man, he started using English and I<r> understood that he started using English to divert my attention from some <r>from his gender and wanted me to understand him as a larger part of the community who speaks English so that I can<r> give him something. So they also use English <er>  as a means of attaining power. So I also want to understand that what identity do they want to get by using English in their language. <er>  the methodology would be, I would be<er> choosing the self-proclaimed and self-identified transgender in the<r> society of <er>  Rawalpindi. <er>  my sample would be ten people <er>  they<r> would be more than of thirty of <er>  age because transgender theory highlights that <er>  they start to have conflict in the society after they are, they reach puberty and thirty, when they are and not twelve year old.  And when they have sufficient experience, once they have sufficient experience I want to understand the <er>  identities of those people who have sufficiently lived in the contradictory […]life<er> in the society. I would be using critical discourse analysis because I want to understand their language their identity through their language. I want to understand that why they are using such language and why, what identities they are portraying and why they are portraying those identities and what ways they are trying to gain and what powers they want to achieve.
