M1: ok!  Bismilah. Thank you so much madam. Good Morning! <er> My name is Sareer Ahmad and <er>  topic of my research proposal is “Othering of Muslim Immigrants in H.M Naqvi’s Home Boy and Abdullah Hussein’s Emigre Journeys: A Study of Psychological Borders. And my supervisor is Dr.Inayat. Thank you sir for supervising me. <er>  yes, this is the overview of my presentation. First of all, I will talk about the introduction and after that the statement of the problem, research questions, objectives, significance of the study, literature review, research methodology and theoretical framework. <er> Now coming to the introduction part, Borderland. First of all, I will talk about the borders that what are actually borders and Anzaldua, the <h> <r>  critic that I am going to choose for my study, she said that, “border is a creation of a line between two entities between two geographical, <r> entities between two cultural entities. And this a border this can divide two separate states, two separate you can say <er>  two separate ideology as well, two separate division between “us” and “them” as well. People of either side, either they are living on this side of the border or they are living at the other side of the border, they face a struggle of, a <h> struggle for their identity. <er>  yes, coming to the psychological border which is the main focus of my study, and Anzaldua said that, “psychological border is an invisible line between “their” and “aliens”. This invisible line is that can be a collective state of mind or that can be a individual state of mind. And she is saying that this is something within each of us either that person is <h> living in, either that person is native or either that person is foreigner. Even then, further she is saying that different overviews of insiders and outsiders also here. A person who is living of the other side, either he is native either he is a foreigner, ok the what <h> what are the things that overview of the world, <h> their opinions, their <r> opinions about the world, their opinions about different other things, they are different. <er> Now coming to the statement of the problem, yes you have seen that people cross the border. People cross the psychological <h> sorry, the geographical border, the physical border but after that there they face problems. What is the problem, the problem is that they cross the border for job purpose, sometimes <r> they reside there permanently, they went for <r> a families for the sake of family. But the aftermath of the border crossing is not always positive. It often causes the stress for the people and can affect their lives badly. […] And now coming to the objectives. Research objectives are: to explore the contributions of the psychological borders as a factor responsible for the treatment of immigrants as others to the host country. Number second is to examine how members of the immigrant community are misrepresented within a larger society. Number third is to investigate the role of border crossing in making the immigrants feel as lost beings on the other side of the border. […] Coming to the research question, the first question is, what are the psychological borders, how are they developed by both, hosts and immigrants as well? How do psychological borders play a role in the treatment of immigrants as “others” in H.M. Naqvi’s novel “Home Boy” and Abdullah Husseins’s novel that is “Emigre Journeys”? <er> And the third question is, In what ways do psychological borders keep the immigrants at periphery and <er> create and generate radicalized image of the members of immigrant community? […] Yes, significance of the study, the present study is significant for determining the role of psychological border in making the immigrants and hosts as others <r> for each other. <er> The study will provide a perspective that will shed light on the psychological borders that are present wherever two cultures meet whatever the edges of two cultures meet each other. These literal and metaphorical borders are dealing the people towards the state of bewilderment about their identity. […] Now coming to the literature review, <er> yes <er> when <r> <h> we talk about the borderland when we talk about <er>  the hybridity, of course there are a lot of work that have been done by different other people but there are some references that I have given, some <h> researchers that I am going to quote. Number first is Omoniyi and he mentions that the presence of psychological borders is only in insiders. Those who are hosts, <r> they there the psychological border is there only in their mind not in those who are coming towards the host country. Now Hegen in 2009 says that the main focus of Hegen’s study was on the physical and invisible lines that we can see not on the psychological borders. And he said that those <r> things which are there the physical lines and the invisible, the visible lines, they are responsible for the person’s identity and <er> identity question. <er>  yes, Micheal Dear talks about the globalization and hybridity. He said that globalization is here and globalization is responsible for the hybridity of different nations. […] Yes Zubair yes he is a Pakistani researcher in 2012 <er> there is <r> <h> a research article and he talked about the border crossing and hybridity in Pakistani fiction. His main focus was only in hybridity not on psychological borders or how psychological borders are going to, to play their role in the hybridity and in the <er> state of, in the confusion state. Yes <er> the second study was <er> <r> conducted by <er> Gome sorry <er> <h> Gomezpena and he’s talked about the physical state and mental state. A gap between two worlds. Whatever the physical state is upper that there is a mental state, there a gap and because of that gap we are facing hybridity. Now coming to the Hergoz (2009) hybridity at individual level depends on one’s mental state. As I have mentioned earlier that Anzaldua is talking about the collective state of mind as well but here he is talking about only the individual state of mind. […] Now coming to the methodology, <er> the present study is qualitative in nature and the main focus of the study is on the presence of psychological border and the role and its role in making the immigrants and hosts as other for each other. And the thorough perusal of the selected literary texts are also included in the methodology. <er> The search for incidents/ events <er> portraying the ‘othering’ of Muslim immigrants that is also written in my method. The selected critical theories that is Anzaldua will be studied with the specific, with a special references to the psychological borders. And after that, I will <r> there will be an application of that critical framework on the selected literary works. […] Yes, coming to the literary <er> theoretical framework the main focus and the famous Anzaldua’s <er> point of view on borderline theory and within that there is another view that that is about psychological borders so that psychological border has been chosen by the researcher as a framework and he is going to apply on the theory <er> <h> on the selected works. Yes, Anzaldua asserts in <er> 1987 that the psychological borders are not specific to one place. <er> They are present wherever two societies edge each other, where individuals of various races share a same region under, lower, middle and privileged societies touch. Hatred, outrage and maltreatment are the main components of the landscape. […] Yes coming to the research tools, these are three research tools that <er> I have selected for my study that I am going to apply I am going to analyze according to these three <er> tools my selected data. And the first tool is <h> identity consciousness and the second is hybridity and the third is psychological conflict. In first statement we talk about identity consciousness that is the statement that comes when the <r> <h> immigrants they just cross the physical border, the geographical border, after they some <er> after they enter to another states <er> another state sorry and in that state they are going to talk about <er> they are going to face identity consciousness they are identity conscious because they are facing a great fear of their identity <er> because of the host country. And now the second on is the concept of hybridity when they face this <r> thing this identity consciousness after that at the second stage when they want themselves to be merged with the host country when they want themselves to be accepted by the host country so that they try to be, they try to cross that psychological borders and when they try to cross the psychological borders there comes the second stage that is hybridity. And after being hybrid, they are <er> there is another stag that is psychological conflict. Within that psychological conflict those who are already hybrid they are, they are facing this state. Why? Because when they are hybrid, when they are hybrid, even those who are host they are not accepting as they are. And those who are their natives previously, they were also not accepting them, e.g., <er> whenever there a person, a person comes from U.S here we are saying that you are from U.S though he is Pakistani. Whenever that person goes there, he is a national there <h> the people who are there are saying that you are Pakistani. So there you are saying that you are from U.S and there they are saying that you are from Pakistan. So they are in between. So there comes the psychological conflict and they are <r> othered there is a double concept of double othering from both of the sides from their own society and from the society they are living in there abroad. <er> Yes and after that there are some references <er> for my study and <er> yes thank you for the presentation and I’m <er> here for the question answer session.
