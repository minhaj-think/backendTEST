M1: Bismillah. The topic of my M.Phil research is “Syntactic Analysis of Classroom Discourse”. […] <er> now this topic <er> the terms that I’m going to introduce is minimalism. What minimalism is. According to Noam Chomsky, “minimalism is an attempt to ask not only what the properties of language are but why they are that way”. […] Minimalist program is a collection of four articles presented by Noam Chomsky. In these four articles, the first one is the theory of principles and parameters. Second is some notes on economy of Derivation and representation. Third is, a minimalist program for linguistic […] theory. Fourth is categories and transformations. […] I’ll look for minimalist program. In minimalist program, null constituent, we also call it empty categories, have grammatical and semantic features but lack audible phonetic feature-silent or inaudible. Constituent means syntactic units. Wh-movement where the word like what or who <er> moves from the original place. Head-movement, the movement of head word within a phrase. Statement of the problem is <er> written syntax has been researched from minimalistic approach but limited research have been done in spoken syntax. Syntactic structures of Pakistani English teachers at university level have not been analyzed from minimalistic approach. This research is aimed to analyze syntactic structures of those lectures which are being delivered at post graduate level […]. Research objectives, to find null constituent in syntactic structure of of English lectures delivered for post graduate level. To identify the wh-movement in recorded English lectures for post graduate level. To investigate Head Movement in English lectures at phrasal level. Research question, which null constituents do Pakistani English teachers employ […] in classroom discourse at post graduate level? How do English teachers position ‘wh’ in academic discourse at post graduate level? How does Head-movement influence different phrases in academic discourse at post graduate level? Significance of the study would be, <er> the study seeks to explore the syntactic structure of academic discourse at post graduate level. As it is obvious that syntax is the important element of core linguistics which needs to be explored and analyzed. Therefore, this research is aimed to explore the level of English teachers syntactic structures. This study will help the students, teachers, researchers, syntacticians and academic discourse community to know more about the parameters or categories in English lectures delivered at university level. […] Delimitation of the study, my study will be delimited […] the present study is limited to the syntactic structures used at post graduate level (BS <h> English classes). The data will be collected from three different universities of Pakistan that includes, Air University Islamabad, International Islamic University Islamabad, NUML Islamabad. […] Research methodology. Research Design. The study is based on mixed method where the data will be analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. In qualitative method I shall analyze the syntactic patterns of the recorded English lectures from the four universities. The frequency of syntactic patterns will be analyzed quantitatively. […] Theoretical framework. Minimalist program <er> Noam Chomsky, 1995. To investigate the minimal unit of a sentence. In this framework, I’ll be going for […] to find out these <r> constituents in my research. Null constituent. In null constituents, null subjects. […] Non-finite null subject for instance, we don’t want anyone to upset them. We don’t want, […] anyone is null here, it is a null constituent. We don’t want to upset them. Finite null subject. Imperative null subject means intrinsically second […] person. Truncated null subject. Shortened, i.e., we <h> <r> I can’t come. <r> Null auxiliaries. Null T in auxiliaries final clauses. He enjoys syntax. He enjoyed syntax. Number first He does enjoy syntax. Here T (tense) is null in auxiliary […] less. And the second He enjoyed syntax. He did enjoy syntax. […] Tense is null here and auxiliary less. Null T in bare infinitive clauses. I have never known (Tom criticize anyone). T (tense) is null and bare infinitive. Without infinitive. The correct would be like, I have never known Tom to criticize anyone. Null C in finite clauses. We didn’t know (if he had resigned). We didn’t know (that he had resigned). ‘If’ and ‘that’ C <i> are null here. We didn’t know (he had resigned). […] Null C in non-finite clauses. Null determiners and quantifiers. We linguists. John, is without […] determiner. We can add ‘the John’ or within it a determiner here. Wh-movement and Head-movement. Data collection. Data would be collected through audio device. Every lecture would be recorded in form of audio recording. The lectures would be collected from English department of selected universities through convenience sampling. Population and sampling. 15 lectures from male teachers and 15 female teachers. Air University, ten lectures. International Islamic […] University Islamabad, ten lectures. NUML Islamabad, ten lectures. Total, thirty lectures. Data Analysis. I’ll analyze my data <er> by using parsing or tree diagram.
