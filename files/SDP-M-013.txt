F1: My name is Maria Sani and my supervisor is Dr. Inayat Ullah. Today I’m here for my synopsis defense’ presentation and the topic of my research is “A Comparative Study of Linguistic Tropes in Raja Gidh and A God in Every Stone”. […] <er> Meaning and language comes about through style or the linguistic choices that a writer makes either consciously or unconsciously. And this style vary according to different factors such as genre, <er> context, historical period or the author. <er> Analyzing language of a text according to Gilles systematically looking at the formal features of the text and <h> that determining the functional significance for interpreting of text for <i> So while analyzing the language stylistic analysis helps us in, helps us in better understanding the similarities and differences in different languages. So this <er> stylistic <er> study is different in literature and linguistic. When we <er> say that it is <er> <r> literary stylistics so literary stylistics basically focuses only on the artistic effects and when it comes to linguistic stylistics, <er> in linguistic stylistics there is a focus on the study of language and <er> the creativity of <er> language in different texts. So, <er> as we all know that language has its particular way of writing and expressing different things. So whenever we need a (test) in any language we, <er> <r> come across different tropes and <er> these tropes are sometimes similar in different languages which we call as universal tropes. As stylistic analysis helps us in understanding these tropes which <er> which operate in the written text as these are all the effects achieved through the language and though the building of (provident) linguistic structures. <er> so each trope gives rise to its own mental spaces and each mental space is according to the Gilles Fauconnier’s are the conceptual <er> <r> packets and <er> these <er> and these mental spaces are internally structured by the frames and cognitive models by so and <er> and externally also known as connectors that relate mental spaces to one another. And whenever <er> and <er> and this theory of mental spaces <er> is proposed by Gilles Fauconnier and <er> his <er> and his theory is ‘Mental Space Theory’. <er> And on the basis of this mental space theory, <er> if speakers <er> if Urdu speakers read <er> any kind of <er> English trope in a text whose cognate is there in Urdu language then <er> they only need to link English trope with Urdu trope. And I will explain this concept later on. So, […] <er> my statement of problem is <er> Readers while reading the text in second or foreign language often face difficulty in understanding the real message. And <er> second language readers are sometimes unable to create mental spaces for tropes used in second language. The problem of interpreting these tropes lie in the necessity to render their figurative meaning while maintaining the same imagery of the original. My research objectives are to analyze English and Urdu tropes in the <h> in the hope to find out the degree to which they are comparable or diverse. And my second research <h> objective is to investigate the importance of tropes in meaning construction. On the basis of my research objectives, my research questions are What are the similarities and differences in the usage of English and Urdu tropes? And my second research question is how tropes helpful in the construction of meaning through mental spaces? Significance of my study is to bring to light some areas of cognitive research which have received less attention, and also the figurative <h> figurative language so that the readers will get the whole idea, the real message or what actually the writer wants to convey through the use of tropes through the use of figurative language. This research study will enrich the study of tropes and hopefully it will <er>  it will be used as reference for those who are interested in <r> figurative language analysis in <er> linguistic stylistics analysis. It will also improve knowledge of readers especially in comparing linguistic features of different languages. Delimitation of the study is that it is delimited to only focusing on the four tropes and these four trope are the <er> are the master tropes <er> proposed by Kenneth Burke <er> and these four master tropes are metaphor, metonymy, irony and synecdoche and the two novel are A God in Every Stone and Raja Gidh taken from <er> taken one from each language. Raja Gidh is Urdu and A God in Every Stone is English. […] <er> by doing literature review figurative language according to Rosa and <er>  and Eschholz is the language used in a creative rather than a literal sense. <er> They basically proposed the <er> the <h> <er> the <er> that figurative language is used mostly in <er> in <h> <er> creative writings and <er> their focus was on creativity and <er> the <er> and <er> <r> creative language. And the second literature reviews of the <er> <r> Kovecses that claims that there is an equal focus on the importance of metaphorical language not only in the English language but in many other languages of the world. They proposed that this figurative language and this use of tropes is not only in English language but in different language of the world. And <er> when I was reviewing literature I came across <er> this <r> book which is in Urdu <r> k Asaleeb e Bayan by Dr. Muhe Addin <h> Qadri Zoor. And <er> he <r> compared Urdu stylistics and <er> English stylistics, style of Urdu and English writers in <er>  in his book and this book is on the Asloob and Asaleeb. […] So my methodology is that it is a qualitative research. The tools selected for <er> for this research are constant interpretation of data from beginning to the end and side by side I will compare <er> that data. And my data sample is one novel <er> from Urdu Raja Gidh which is by Bano Qudsia and second novel is in English which is A God in Every Stone by Kamila Shamsie and the data will be qualitatively collected and analyzed on the basis of comparative analysis that the that how the data is similar or diverse in two languages. I basically used two theoretical frameworks one is <h> Keneth Burke’s “Four Master Trope’s” theory which was published in 1941 and <er> his four master tropes are metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche and irony. And second one and the second theoretical framework is “Mental Space Theory” developed by Fauconnier in his book <er> Mental Spaces: Aspects of meaning Construction in <er> in Natural Language. And he proposed this Mental Space Theory that how the cognates are working that how these mental spaces are the conceptual packets. <er> So the <er> four master Tropes are metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche and irony. Metaphor is the comparison made by referring to <er> one thing <er> as another like we can say that <er> like Kamila Shamsie said in his book that she was <er> <h> was a spinster <er> at the age of forty so he used a metaphor of spinster for <i> so <er> these kind of metaphors are also there in Urdu language which I will <er> study <er> in Raha Gidh. And then Metonymy, metonymy is the reference to something or someone by naming one of it its attributes. <er> Like if are <er> discussing <er> U.S. president and we say that <er> White House at risk <i> so we are basically talking about the U.S. president <er> but we are not using his name or his attribute but <er> we are saying that White House is <i> And then third one is synocdoche which is a <er> whole is represented by name of  <er>  of one of its parts like if I say that  <er> the whole world is against me so it’s not like <er>  the whole world is against me but <er>  some of the people are but I’m saying that the whole world is against me so it is an example of synecdoche. And then irony, irony is speaking in such a way as to imply the contrary of what one says, often for the purpose <er> of derision, mockery, or jest. It is <er> like if we are talking about the bad times and we are saying that nowadays <er> <r> I feel sick of time. So this is kind of irony. […] Then Mental Space Theory, this Mental Space Theory is proposed by Fauconnier, describing meaning construction through through ‘Mental Space Theory’ in his book Mental Spaces: Aspects of Meaning Construction in Natural Languages. During meaning construction, mental spaces linked to one another in various ways, allowing readers to ‘link back’ mental spaces constructed earlier <er> in the thought process. Mental spaces according to Fauconnier are internally structured by frames and cognitive models and externally are linked by so-called connectors that relate mental spaces to one another. And <er> if the readers are <er> are reading <er> if Urdu speakers are reading in English language and they come across <er>  different words which are there in English language relating back to their own <er> <r> first language and then they relate cognates of the English language with cognates of Urdu language. So this is how the Mental Space Theory which was proposed by Fauconnier. And the data analysis, the approach for the data analysis would be “thematic approach” which is the most adequate way to reveal similarities, differences and contradictions involved in certain definitions to reveal the aspects that determine the analysis of a trope. Basically <er> my study is not the context-based study where we are top focusing on the historical background and on the other things. My study is only the textual study where I am only focusing on the text and the language used in <er> those texts. So data will be collected in two ways. <er> Urdu data will be collected manually and English data will be collected through corpus techniques through using <er> <r> the AntConc corpus.  So these are some of the references which I used. Thank you!
