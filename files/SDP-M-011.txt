M1: Bismilah… Aslam O Alikum and good afternoon everyone. <er> The topic of this presentation is “Condemnation of War and Terror in Contemporary Pakistani Fiction: Identifying Appraisal in the Text”. So the outline of this study. <er> First I will introduce the topic then the data for the study, research questions, objectives, methodology and finally theoretical framework. Coming towards the introduction of this topic. The present technological advancements and scientific discoveries has also brought some serious evils. These been spread to every corner of the world. Specifically the incident of 9/ 11 pushed the world into a war where peace has become a distant dream. This war has unleashed so many terrorists networks. So as a result all the written material whether they are film industry, short stories and other novels, they have fallen prey of this warlike atmosphere. […] Continuing the introduction, <c> Ramanan says that if the world changed after the incident of 9/ 11, literature also changed. So this statement clearly shows the impact of 9/ 11 and other subsequent attacks on the literature of this time. […] Different writers narrated these terrorists events from multi dimensions. As the title of this topic suggests that <c> <er> writers have condemned and they have shown certain resistance to violence acts which is <er> continued in the history throughout in the history of literature. We we can see that the writers have never endorsed the violence acts which can endanger human life but they have shown their resistance and they have shown their love for humanity like <h> from the Punjabi poets, we can say that Habib Jalib,  Mureed Niazi they have taken such a <er>  duty. In the English literature we can quote this area. <c> Again Eliot depicts the <er> impacts of World War first in his poetry. He wrote Wasteland to describe the modern world as a wasteland where the land is immortal. In The Hollow Men he again tell the emptiness of religion and society and even life after post war period. He described <h> his poetry that war has contaminated all aspects of society. So this study is also an attempt to see how Pakistani authors have portrayed violence and extremism in their works. <c> The data for this study of two novels that have been selected from a correction to random sampling. The Scatter here is too Great by Bilal Tanveer. <er> This novel published in 2013 and offers an insight into urban Pakistan Karachi <er> at a time when it is engulfed by violence and extremism. One Karachi afternoon is caused on people crowd to (opposite) street. A bomb explode. Nothing will be the same for the new stone award by this ugly war. So here the writer Bilal Tanveer reveals the pain and loneliness and tragedies of these people. <er> The next work is of Nadeem Aslam The Blind Man’s Garden that starts in the aftermath of 9/ 11 and takes place largely in Pakistan. This is the story of two brothers Joe and Mikal. They are from the Village (Heath) from the Punjab province of Pakistan. <er> They went secretly to Afghanistan at the time when the when the tensions were intensified between the <hmm> Afghan Afghani Taliban and the American soldiers. So, <er> through the perspective of these two characters the writer have showed that how war and how violence <er>   have targeted in <er> <h>  <r> the innocence of the society. And this study lies under the umbrella term of critical terrorism studies. As we know after 9/ 11 terrorism studies have gone under a major transformation. And this <er> this <r> approach <er> studies the issues of terrorism from a critical perspective. And it is <er> it challenges the <er> weakness and the <er> orthodox terrorism studies based on rigorous empirical findings. The research questions of this study is <h> are that, how the phenomena of terrorism and violence portrayed in the contemporary Pakistan fiction? What extense the rising tides of extremism linked to the various shades of resistance? How the writer have shown the resistant to certain violent acts and what extent? How the character’s responses are being evaluated and how far do the writers convey their emotions, pity and fear? This again the most important part of this study because as we know in the post-war community the emotions of <er> disappointment get <er> prevailing. So this again the same thing. Objectives, to highlight the impact of rising terrorism on the <er> politics and the education system of the country to establish a new parameter to define the concept of terrorism and its reflections in the novel. Terrorism is <er> again is a debatable issue. So <er> this study will give us the picture <er> the whole picture of terrorism that <er> who are the terrorist in the <er> writer’s perspective. And to disclose the enormous strength of pen and the writer’s critique on the subject matter. How the writer have shown resistance. <h> Significance of this study this contribute <er> this study will contribute to the terrorism studies with new intellectual talents. And it offers an insight into the nature of literary practices. And is gets the researcher to undertake studies in different contexts. For example, they can <er> they can describes the <r> resistance shown by the poets or other type of genre. The main purpose of this study is to <er> is to describe the mental attitude of the novelist <er> whether the writers have portrayed negatively or positively the victims of the war. So this again stance the mental attitude of the writer. The methodology of this study. It is descriptive in nature. And it implies both qualitative and quantitative methods, […] supports the arguments through textually culled evidence and it uses appraisal for analyzing evaluation and stance in a text. Appraisal is a framework an from sustaining functional linguistics which is developed in 1990 by <er> Martin and now it is used in social sciences research worldwide. Appraisal is used for textual analysis of a text. <er> it will <er> <r> be familiar to that <h> students who have studied discourse in discipline. So appraisal is used for analyzing evaluation so what is evaluation in the SFL language. Evaluation is that how the speaker or writer takes either a positive or negative views of the participants, actions or state of fears. So this is evaluations. And the stance, what is the mental attitude of the writer towards certain phenomena in a text. […] So appraisal. <er> from this framework I will <er> take three things, three language phenomenas. Attitude, engagement and graduation. Attitude means human emotional reactions expressed in discourse. How the writer have shown the emotions, <er> the emotional responses of the characters. And engagement when the writer creating <h> spaces for otherwises and he includes certain other characters in his narrative. Graduation means when the writers uses words in order to increase the intensity of certain utterances. I will give example at the end. <c> Like for example I have <er> these are the examples from the novels. Attitude, like “angry killers” tell us explicitly the emotional state of the killers. This lies under the <er> attitude for the <er> framework. Graduation for example here <er> general example, the educational system places “too” much emphasis on the grades and less on integrity. So this is graduation here the writer used “too” in order to increase the intensity of the utterance. As the title of the study suggest condemnation. For example, the writer have <er> shown <er> the <er> used certain words for example deadly bomb blast, ugly war. This is again graduations. This is an example from the novels The Scatters here is too Great. A lover with his beloved driving to a sea for entertainment, and suddenly on the way the <r> blast went off as a result everything scattered and the windscreen of the car is smashed by a strayed bullet. So here the writer <er> <r> have described the emotional state and <er> as a response to this blast. The character says “Why I have to deal with this? I don’t deserve what a damn hell.” So <h> <er> this I “why I have to deal with this?” and here it is used again “I don’t deserve”. So it is <er> the voice of the <er> of the writer. The writer associate himself with the perception <er> <er> of the speaker. Here he <r> sponsor <er> here he supports the arguments of the speaker. And it reveals the pain and emotions at the time of incident. So this is the end of the slide.
