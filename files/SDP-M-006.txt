M1: Bismilah… The name is Muhammad Tayyab Kamal. The topic that I have chosen for my research is “From Homeland to Hopeland: A Diasporic Marxist Perspective on Khaled Hosseini’s The Kite Runner and the Mountains Echoed”. The thing that has clicked me for this research is that often we use such topics that meet the identity crisis issues among the diaspore writers and the diaspore literature. <er> I have chosen these texts because there is something that clicked me that is the <er> economic aspects. The characters in these <er> <r> novels have this tendency to <er> adopt anywhere such as such thing has been portrayed in these novels like the this <h> the term <er> transcedental homelessness is given by this very fight by Jaw Boogacks and according to this very concept, <er> character can be at home anywhere in the world. This idea is foregrounded in two of his books. In the first book “Sole and Form”, Jol Boogacks tells us that <er> “human sole is something that had been detached or lost his privilege its privileged position. And then yearns to achieve that”. And in this very <er> theory of the novel book in which <er> he has this he does <r> this analysis of the <h> Stopskeys’ novels. He gaves us this idea <r> of trancedental homelessness in which he says that this sole this character has this ability to at home anywhere. Wherever the <er> body the soul goes because the actual position has been lost in order to achieve that position in order to complete itself it yearns <er> or struggles to achieve that thing back. So this is the basically the concept of trancedental homelessness. This is what the characters are doing in these texts. In this very research I am discussing or highlighting the economic aspects and since the cultural aspects can not be <er> neglected So I am keeping them on the second <er> like level. And my strategy would be that <er> in this research I would start with the <r> this homelessness thing I’ll be telling about the <er> how these characters are homeless and what they do in order to achieve this very thing. And then there will be this <er> From Homeland to Hopeland, this is about their movement from their native land to their […] hopeland which we can call the west as has been portrayed by <er> Khaled Hosseini in her novels. Now this space that from and to, is given in this very space I can discuss the relationship that these characters develop with their <h> hopeland. There <er> we <r> can say host culture. There are two types of things that are highlighted that come across that we come across in these novels. First is there are two generations that are present, the older generation and the younger generation. The older generation, though they migrate to west, still they have this nostalgic affiliation with their land with their <er> homeland. On the other hand, the new generation completely assimilates with the host culture. So in order to discuss both of the aspects I have use thus with the concept of ambivalence given by Homi Baba, in which he says that these <er> <h> in <r> which these characters will have the attraction and repulsion at the same time for the host culture. Attraction on part of the <er> younger generation and repulsion or you we can say nostalgic, rather the nostalgic tendency of the older generation towards the native land. […] After <er> discussing this relationship I’ll come to the writer and as I was saying before that is, writer has tried to advocate this very <er> < h > this <r> very conception that <er> west is the ultimate home for the diaspora people <er> for this there is <er> this researcher, Anthony Apiya, he <h> in his article in the post <er> <h> is the post <h> is postmodern <h> in the  post-modernism, the post in post-colonial, in this article he tells us about the concept of comprador intellectuals. The comprador intellectuals are actually the western style western taught intellectuals, who mediate for the global this capitalism and that very issue is being highlighted in this text because so I’ll be associating this concept of comprador intellectual in Khaled Hosseini as well. So not only I’ll be discussing the migration and the relationship of migrants with their <er> host culture, I’ll also be <er> discussing <er> this stance of the writer the comprador intellectual stance that he adopts for these writers.
