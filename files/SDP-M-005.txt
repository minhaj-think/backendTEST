M1: My name is Sulaiman Ahmed and the topic of my research study is “Errors Committed by the Pashtun EFL Learners in the Area of English Lexical Stress”. <er> This is <er> universal knowledge that stress is a very important aspect of <er> learning and <er> acquisition of a language. And <er> there are two features of pronunciation, segmental features and supra-segmental features and most of the researchers are of the opinion that supra-segmental features can have greater and deeper impact on the <er> intelligibility of the <er> language learners. So <er> stress is one of the supra-segmental feature. And the thing about the English stress is that it is phonemic stress. There are two types of stress, one is phonetic stress and the other is phonemic stress. Unlike phonetic stress, phonemic <r> stress is that a <r> change in the acquisition of twitch in a word can bring a considerable change in the meaning of the word. For example, if we say o’bject and ob’ject, similarly <i> I’nsert and in’sert, reb’el and re’bel. So if we change the position of the stress in a word it can bring a considerable change in the meaning of that word. So, the basic problem is that <er> in English language as well as in Pashto language, the position of stress is on <r> syllable or word that is not fixed. It varies from word to word. So <er> one another problem is that there are difference between the stress patterns of Pashto language and of the English language. And Pashtun learners of English language they making they make negative transfer and they applying stress patterns and the habits of their mother tongue that is Pashto to the <er> stress to the words of English language and that is why they mispronounce the English words with incorrect stress position. So this the problem that I am going to sort out. […] <int: <i>> ok, sir <er> There are two groups of participants and two research tools I have selected for the study. For <er> <r> finding out the errors I will select sixty students from four major universities of Khyber Pakhtun Khuwa and I will give them a list of words, 150 words, I have already made <er> the interview here. I will select 150 words disyllabic and tri <h> tetra-syllabic words. Similarly I will <er> <int> I will <er> categorize those words into different groups according to the number of syllables in the words and the position of stress in those words. Similarly I will<er> <h> <r> use disyllabic words into AC sentences in order to find out and highlight the grammatical category of the word. For example, o’bject and ob’ject. So I will have to use these words into different sentences. […] And I’ll ask the students to read aloud these words and sentences and I will <er> make an audio recording using <i> Then I will <r> analyze the collected data using through using a phonetic sphere that is called Traut. And I will measure the three features of stress including <er> pitch, intensity, and duration. So this is <r> how I will find out the errors that whether I have compared the performance with the correct stress <h> with the words. Correct stress position that are given in the Oxford or Cambridge dictionary electronic dictionaries. So this how I’ll be finding out the errors. Then I will ask the teachers who are teaching phonetics and phonology that in the universities. And <er> I will ask them <er> certain questions regarding the reasons behind those errors and for the remedies of those errors. This is how I will […] do.
