New historicism emphasizes the historicity of a text by relating it to the configuration of power, society, and ideology in a given time. Literary and non-literary texts are given equal weightage. This “equal weighting” in Louis Montrose words, is a “combined interest in the ‘texuality of history, and the historicity of texts’”. Here are some references of this study. Thank you!
