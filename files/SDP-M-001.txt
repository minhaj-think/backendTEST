M1: My name is Ahmed Bilal from M.Phil Linguistics second semester and the topic of my research is “Narrative of Counter Terrorism: […] A Critical Discourse Analysis of General Raheel Sharif’s Speeches”. […] As to the question of narrative, it is defined as coherent system of inter-related and sequential organized stories. Sequence of related events, stories that are related to the specific events of the history share a common rhetorical desire to resolve a conflict via establishing audience expectations according to <M2: int> literaries and rhetorical form. Now the next question that comes to my mind as a researcher that how narratives are formed? So narratives are basically stories which are inculcated into the minds of people in the form of ideologies and as we know that ideologies are always <c> inculcated in the mind by the power houses of the society. The main power houses like the rulers, the political elite, […] and the economic elite as well. And the <r> and these narratives are always linked to the geo-contextual history and the popular traditions of the target narrative, targeted country. And when these ideologies they keep on moving and when these stories <r> stories are <er> accepted by <er> by the major power <er> by the people of the society then they become <er> master narratives. […] <er>As to the second part of my topic terrorism […]. Unlawfull terrorism is define basically defined as unlawful use of violence [M2:int].
