M1: Aslam o Alikum Everyone! Before starting my presentation I would like to thank you all for being here for attending my presentation. […] <er>  The topic of my research which I am going to conduct is “A Corpus Based Study of Evidentiality in Selected Pakistani and British Newspaper Editorials”. <c> So everyone knows that corpus is the collection of text. It can be written or spoken <c> and the <er> it is in machine readable form for example, if you want to analyze a corpus you compile a corpus and then you have softwares like AntConc and you can use that to you know count the frequency, to count the frequency how many times a particular <h> word or linguistic expression occurs and what is the function of that marker. That is why the main advantage of this study is that you can you know study <er> <h> you can analyze a huge corpus in you know limit it in a short time. <c> And there is also such implications in <h> classroom like in corpus you <er> <r> also <er> study words in context that this words occurs with that words and that collocates that words. Now […] coming towards evidentiality as this word is self-explanatory evidentiality means evidence. Have you an evidence for something for affect you know making <h> information you are imparting arguing. Have you any sort of evidence? What is the source of that information? That is called evidentiality. And you know every time for persuasive writing, evidentiality plays a vital role because it does not only provide background information but also strengthen <r> your arguments. That is why the study of evidentiality….. < int: M2: what do you mean by it? Can you give an example> For example, if I say that according to Panama, “a particular politician is the most corrupt person in the world”. According to Panama, this is the source. This is the evidence I have. < int: M2: Do you know that evidentiality is grammatically encoded or there are strategies to express evidentiality?> In some languages like Quincha and Tuba and other languages it is grammatically expressed. There are some glatics prefixes and suffixes. < int: M2: And what are the four types of evidentiality?>  Four types? So every writer has <er> you know <er> provide some <er> <int: F1:  presentation <er> ap slides agy chlo na ap <er>. 	M	2: vo agy ja hi ni rha. <L> <i>> This is the overview of my presentation. <er> I will first introduce the terms like evidentiality. What is evidentiality? What are editorials? And then I will present my questions like what the study aims to you know <er> to find the answers for and then why this study has significance. Why is this study significant? And then I would <er> review some literature on that topic and then I would talk about research methodology. What type of methodology I am going to employ for the current study or what kind of theoretical framework am I going to employ for the current study. […] Now editorial, coming towards editorial. If you know the newspaper, there are various sections like there might be a <h> national section, international section and editorial section. The National section just only provide facts that what is happening in the <h> in the country. For example, the DAWN newspaper, it would you know provide you the fact that these events are taking place in Pakistan. International type of <er>, international <er> <r> <c> you know international what is happening in the world? The report would be about but what is editorial. The most interesting section of the newspaper is editorial because it is <er> the mixture of both facts and opinions. It does not only provide facts that what is happening but also you know <h> but also <er> <r> provide you the newspaper comments on those particular events. The point of view of the editorial is <h> of the newspaper is presented in the editorial. <c> Now types of editorial. Bell classified editorials into attacks, criticism, defense and praise. Editorial deals with many kind of subject, subject matter. For example, < int: M2: what is the difference between attack and criticism?> What is the difference between attack and criticism? Attack is the severe form of <h> criticism. <Int: M2: severe form of> <er> criticism. For example, if you want to criticize <er> a politician, so you can write about that in <er> editorial section that why you <er> criticize him. For example, if I say that according to Panama League, “he is the most corrupt <er> politician” that is why. Now coming toward the definition of evidentiality. According to Aikhenvald, “Evidentiality is linguistic category whose primary meaning is source of information”. The information you are giving is, what is the source? From where you come to know about that specific information you are impart <er> giving it to the reader? […] Now Corniclie classified evidential markers into the following groups. He first…<er> there is one type is direct. The person who is imparting <r> or giving information has witnessed the action. For example, if I say that he is a thief. So the <h> listener would obviously want you to do <h> to give him some evidence that why you say that a particular person is a thief. I would say that I have seen him in a shop you know, he <r> he’s stolen some money from the shopkeeper. That is visual type of evidentiality. And you it is direct type of evidentiality. Indirect includes inferentials. For example, you have no evidence but <er> you have no source but you know but there are some tangible evidence and on those tangible evidence, you give them information. For example, you say that the dog must be in pain. Now ‘must’ performs two functions, the first <er> function is evidential <er> evidential and the second is modality. For example, you see a dog and it is whimpering and it is making <er> sad voices and there is a cut on his face and there is blood you can make the inference that the dog must be in pain. Where the evidence come from? You make an inference so ‘must’ here perform […] the <er> you know the function of evidentiality. […] Now <c> when you are realizing evidentiality you have to take into account, attribution and evidence. For example, an attribute statement is that which contains a reference to the source of information. And in non-fictional texts like newspaper the statement or the information as attributed to someone else. <c> He said the politician is corrupt. Now he said, the source is ‘he’. It is ‘he’ who give you <er> the information that the politician is corrupt. And there are also <er> evidence like you <r> show your own <h>, interpretation if I say the part, a survey showed, a survey criticized, a report criticized, it means that you are giving you own […] interpretation of that survey or that report. So these type of word should also be analyzed when you are working, analyzing evidentiality because it comes with the source like he criticized, ‘he’ is the source of information and ‘criticizes’ is […] <h> the verb or the attributed verb. […] Now there are two views on evidentiality. One is narrow view of evidentiality. <c> Chafe said that when you are analyzing and adopting a narrow view, you are just analyzing the source of information that from where <er> the information comes. But when you are analyzing it from a broad view you do not only analyze <er> the source but also the attitude of the speaker towards that information what is his opinion about that information. He may qualify his information like some <er> modal expressions like probably and may be things like that. […] So according to Chafe he express <int : F1: <i>> These are the research questions which <er> I am going <er>  which the researcher would attend to answer. What are the evidential markers employed by Pakistani and British editorial writers? Is there any significant difference in terms of occurrence and function of evidential markers in Pakistani and British newspaper editorials? What is the role of evidentiality in strengthening the argumentative structure of the editorials? So this question is very important you know whenever you are analyzing <er> argumentative text you have <er> to know that what is the rule of evidentiality and strengthening the argumentative structure of that editorial. […] The study would contribute to media discourse <int: M2: next please.> Now there is a study on evidentiality in which Soukohi, Norwood and Soltani studied evidentiality evidentials in Persian newspaper editorials and found that an evidential is employed in these columns for not only presenting factual information but also you know <er> as “supportive instrument in order to increase persuasive power of the text”. […] There is the research methodology. The current study employs both qualitative and quantitative approaches. <er> The frequency counts that how many times a particular evidential marker occurs in a textual decounted and the function they perform would be qualitatively analyzed. <int : F2: <er> tahir where is the future tense here? […] the study will employ, you are proposing, use the future tense, the study will employ. > <er> Now there is the population sample. Four newspapers are selected <int: M2: four newspaper? > for the current study. Two newspaper, <er> two British and two Pakistani newspaper would be selected <int: M2: two from the same <i>> <er> I would follow simple sample technique. <int : F2: Explain, how would you select? > For example, if you open the website of that newspaper and you go to the section of editorials it would open the <er>  the daily you know the <er> date is mentioned that on this date three editorials are published so the same date the editorials which appear on the same date will be selected for the study. <int: M2: twenty five.> Twenty five from each newspaper. Twenty five and four two are Pakistani and < int : F2: you have four newspaper, two from Pakistan two from Britain. And twenty five from each newspaper> and 25 from each newspaper 2015 and 2016 the time period. There is the theoretical framework. For example, if the source is the identified individual, I would mark it like the person or the source come comes from the person so <er> h so. information comes from a person and a person is explicitly mentioned. If the person is not mentioned like someone has said then it would be marked as individual unidentified. If a an information comes from a government body, a particular survey or report, it would be deemed as an institutional identified or specified source and when the source is concede then it would be deemed at deemed as institutional uniden…identi…unidentified or unspecified source. (these are based on some work or you are identifying this?) yes, this is based on some work. (Then quote the reference). Now whenever you are presenting information you may not know that how reliable the information is. If you are analyzing from a broad view you have to take into account the epistemic modality like may, might, may be, probably, certainly, possibly, surely, perhaps. So these type of evidential expressions would be also analyzed.
