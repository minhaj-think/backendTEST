M1: My name is Ahmed Bilal from M.Phil Linguistics second semester and the topic of my research is “Narrative of Counter Terrorism: […] A Critical Discourse Analysis of General Raheel Sharif’s Speeches”. […] As to the question of narrative, it is defined as coherent system of inter-related and sequential organized stories. Sequence of related events, stories that are related to the specific events of the history share a common rhetorical desire to resolve a conflict via establishing audience expectations according to <M2: int> literaries and rhetorical form. Now the next question that comes to my mind as a researcher that how narratives are formed? So narratives are basically stories which are inculcated into the minds of people in the form of ideologies and as we know that ideologies are always <c> inculcated in the mind by the power houses of the society. The main power houses like the rulers, the political elite, […] and the economic elite as well. And the <r> and these narratives are always linked to the geo-contextual history and the popular traditions of the target narrative, targeted country. And when these ideologies they keep on moving and when these stories <r> stories are <er> accepted by <er> by the major power <er> by the people of the society then they become <er> master narratives. […] <er>As to the second part of my topic terrorism […]. Unlawfull terrorism is define basically defined as unlawful use of violence [M2:int].
﻿M1: My name is Sikander Seemab and the topic which I’m going to research on is “Persuasion of Masses: Use of NLP in the Speeches of Pakistani and American Politicians”. NLP, it can be termed as Neuro Linguistic Programming and it is […] the way […] how we use the language to manipulate the mind of the audiences. I have chosen this topic because I was <r> interested in finding out what different <er> techniques the politicians they adopt to make the audiences stick to their places and do certain things […] I have […] observed the speeches of great speakers such as […] Adolf Hiltler <h> Hitler <er> Bhutto, Steve Jobs and Barrac Obama. And what I observed from their speeches that all of them they use similar kind of techniques and those techniques are termed under <r> NLP. They use first of all they use rapports. Rapport is a technique […] in which you go into the shoes of the audiences. You make them believe that you are from them. And then they introduce yet sets <r>. In yes sets they introduce some problems which are the core problems of the common masses. They use <er> these sets to make the audiences realize that they know their problems and then they use negative sets. Negative sets set is a term that they connate <er> connate certain negative term with the problems like inflation, terrorism and inflation was caused by the previous government. And then again after negative sets they provide the solution and suggestions as well. We when we come into the into power we will do this and we will do this. They use the term, pronoun, we. They make the audiences realize that alone they can not do anything. With the help of the audiences, they will be able to do certain things. They take the audiences in confidence that with their help they will be able to solve the problems. And later. […] <int: M2:<i>> framework sir, In order to analyze the speeches I have taken Milton’s model. Erickson Milton’s model which was <er> given in 1970’s. <er> The founders of NLP <er> Richard <er> Bandler and John. Brenror, he <er> they both observed the language of Milton. Milton was a <er> psycho-therapist and he used vague language when he was dealing with his clients. He used vague language just because he wanted them to come to the solution of their own problems not <er> he himself wanted to tell the solution. Both these <er> <h> <er> psychiatrist, they analyze these language patterns and they <r> modified it in a model which later become after his name Milton model. And they have given <er> twenty different patterns of language which is found if any speech of <er> certain person that person will be using NLP. And <er> in order to analyze these speeches, I have taken four speeches from four different politicians. <int: M2: Model? > Sir, in the model, there are certain patterns of language. Number one is mind read. They <r> make the audience realize that they know what’s there in their mind like the example is, I know that you believe. They make the audience realize that they know the things which they also know. Loss performity, they <r> talk about certain actions which <er> the doer of the action is not explicit explicitly stated like breathing is good for the effect means if you do this thing the effect will be this. There are <er> twenty like such patterns in which they has used vague language. They have not <h> <er>h straightforwardly stated the solution of the problem but they have left the solution to the audiences to comprehend the solution. 


﻿M1: My name is Sulaiman Ahmed and the topic of my research study is “Errors Committed by the Pashtun EFL Learners in the Area of English Lexical Stress”. <er> This is <er> universal knowledge that stress is a very important aspect of <er> learning and <er> acquisition of a language. And <er> there are two features of pronunciation, segmental features and supra-segmental features and most of the researchers are of the opinion that supra-segmental features can have greater and deeper impact on the <er> intelligibility of the <er> language learners. So <er> stress is one of the supra-segmental feature. And the thing about the English stress is that it is phonemic stress. There are two types of stress, one is phonetic stress and the other is phonemic stress. Unlike phonetic stress, phonemic <r> stress is that a <r> change in the acquisition of twitch in a word can bring a considerable change in the meaning of the word. For example, if we say o’bject and ob’ject, similarly <i> I’nsert and in’sert, reb’el and re’bel. So if we change the position of the stress in a word it can bring a considerable change in the meaning of that word. So, the basic problem is that <er> in English language as well as in Pashto language, the position of stress is on <r> syllable or word that is not fixed. It varies from word to word. So <er> one another problem is that there are difference between the stress patterns of Pashto language and of the English language. And Pashtun learners of English language they making they make negative transfer and they applying stress patterns and the habits of their mother tongue that is Pashto to the <er> stress to the words of English language and that is why they mispronounce the English words with incorrect stress position. So this the problem that I am going to sort out. […] <int: <i>> ok, sir <er> There are two groups of participants and two research tools I have selected for the study. For <er> <r> finding out the errors I will select sixty students from four major universities of Khyber Pakhtun Khuwa and I will give them a list of words, 150 words, I have already made <er> the interview here. I will select 150 words disyllabic and tri <h> tetra-syllabic words. Similarly I will <er> <int> I will <er> categorize those words into different groups according to the number of syllables in the words and the position of stress in those words. Similarly I will<er> <h> <r> use disyllabic words into AC sentences in order to find out and highlight the grammatical category of the word. For example, o’bject and ob’ject. So I will have to use these words into different sentences. […] And I’ll ask the students to read aloud these words and sentences and I will <er> make an audio recording using <i> Then I will <r> analyze the collected data using through using a phonetic sphere that is called Traut. And I will measure the three features of stress including <er> pitch, intensity, and duration. So this is <r> how I will find out the errors that whether I have compared the performance with the correct stress <h> with the words. Correct stress position that are given in the Oxford or Cambridge dictionary electronic dictionaries. So this how I’ll be finding out the errors. Then I will ask the teachers who are teaching phonetics and phonology that in the universities. And <er> I will ask them <er> certain questions regarding the reasons behind those errors and for the remedies of those errors. This is how I will […] do.

﻿M1: Aslam O Alikum Everyone! I’m Kashif Jamshaid MS scholar for 2015 and the topic of my research is “A Corpus Based Islamic Feminist Study of Shahraz’s ‘The Holy Woman’ and Durrani’s ‘Blasphemy’. Professor Dr.Wasima Shehzad is my supervisor. […] The outline of my presentation is, first of all I’ll introduce Islamic Feminism then statement of the problem, research objectives, research questions, significance of the study then research methodology. In research methodology I’ll describe theoretical framework, textual analysis, selected novels, rationale for selecting the novels. […] Islamic Feminism, The term Islamic feminism was first used by Nilufer Gole in 1991. She used this term in her book ‘Forbidden Moderns’. After that Mai Yamani <er> in 1996, she used the term in ‘Feminism and Islam’. Then by the mid of 1990’s, this term was quite famous and it was being used by many scholars from different countries. Then what Islamic Feminists say, they believe that the Holy Quran assures that equality of all human beings regardless of their gender. […] As the Tonnessen, an islamic feminist, from <er> Sudan University, she quotes in her paper on Islamic feminism the words of Asma Barlas, she is a Pakistani American <er> Pakistani American feminist. She says, “I came to the realization that women and men are equal as a result, not of reading feminist texts, but of reading the Quran”. Then why <er> in Muslim countries women are not enjoying this equality. <er> The Islamic feminists they believe that the equality between men and women is obstructed by patriarchal influence and concepts. And to support this patriarchy or patriarchal culture <er> people use unreliable or weak Hadiths <er> against women. That is why Islamic feminists they <er> focus on or their major focus is on the text of the Holy Quran. Although they also conducted studies on <er> the Hadiths and Fiqah from gender perspective. These are the three major approaches used by the Islamic Feminists. <er> First of all their false stories that support <er> male superiority or male dominance. So, they revisited the verses of the Holy Quran to prove and to correct those stories. And then the second approach, there are the verses of the Holy Quran that describe the equality of men and women. <er> So they give references of those verses. And then <er> the third approach, there are verses of the Holy Quran that <er> basically show the difference but these verses were being used by <er> those who support patriarchy. They were using those verses to support patriarchal views or patriarchal culture. So, Islamic Feminists, they deconstruct or reevaluate those verses that <er> describe basically the difference. […] These are the three major approaches. […] <aah> Then statement of the problem, <er> the Western media and most of the Western literature have been biased about Islam and Muslims. Especially the representation of the Muslim women in the Western media and Western literature is soaked with their prejudice and biased attitude. And because of the dominance of the culture and traditions followed in the Muslim majority countries, the Muslim female image is misunderstood. So there is a need to differentiate between the culture, tradition and <er> religion and to present the true image of Muslim women. […] <er> These are the evidences. Patton, <er> she is the researcher. She conducted on, study on the representation of the Muslim women in the Western media and Western literature. She quotes the words of Hifah, a Western Muslim girl. She says, “Especially on women. She is talking about Muslim women. “Especially on women. They would think, “Oh my god, the poor Islamic woman, she’s gonna get an arranged marriage”, or “her husband’s gonna beat her five times a week. The media is spreading bad, different, you know, wrong images of Muslims, especially ladies”. So this, <er>, she continues and says that this is the bad image that <er> Western media and Western literature is presenting so it is our responsibility to present the true image of and we should tell them that we are allowed to get higher education and we are allowed to <er> go out of our homes. This is the second example. Alsultany, she also <er> she is talking about the Muslim women. <er> In her book she says, “… these women have been represented as veiled, oppressed, and in need of rescue. The government and the commercial news media have been central to the circulation of stories about the “oppressed Muslim Woman” <er> and the imperative to “save brown women from brown men”. These are the few examples of the representation of. So these are the research objectives: <ahh> to examine the issues faced by female characters portrayed in the novels from Islamic Feminist perspective. The second objective is to determine the similarities/ differences in the approach of native Pakistani and British Pakistani writers by evaluating similarities/ differences in the depiction of female figures in the novels selected for the current study. The third objective is, to compare the linguistic choices used for the representation of the female gender in the novels with <r> those for the women in the Holy Quran. […] Based upon these objectives, these are the research questions. First, how do the themes concerning women rights in The Holy Woman and Blasphemy conform and/ or contradict the Islamic feministic theory? The second questions is, how are female figures in both novels similar and different with reference to the Islamic feministic theory? The third question is, what types of lexical items have been used to represent the female characters in the selected novels and what role do they play in meaning making? <er> And the fourth question, how do lexical choices affect the feministic discourse infliction and the Holy Quran? […] This is the significance of the study. <er> This study is a contribution to the emerging field of Islamic feminism. It will also differentiate between stereotypes, patriarchal culture or traditions presented in the selected texts and religion […] and moreover, it will clarify Islamic stance on education for women <er>, education for women heritage rights, violence against women and marriage issues etc. […] So how I am going to conduct this study. This is the research methodology. <er> This is qualitative study. I’m going to use the theory of Islamic Feminism. <er> This thoery is based at <er>, upon the works of different scholars. Amina Wadud, Riffat Hassan, Fatima Naseef, they conducted studies on the text of the Holy Quran from gender perspective. Fatima Mernissi and Hidayet Tuksai, they conducted studies on Hadiths and Shaheen Sardar Ali and Aziza al-Hibri, they conducted studies on Islamic jurisprudence. <er> The works of these scholars are the base for <er> the analysis of the text and I’ve  <er> focus on the issues faced by female characters in these texts. […] The method of <er> is textual analysis. Then textual analysis focus on the text itself, <er> language choices, meanings, and other patterns <er>  in texts. And there are three types of textual approaches: genre analysis, corpus analysis and multimodal analysis. But in my study, I am going to use corpus analysis. In the current study, specifically the approach of corpus analysis by using corpus techniques and tools will be used to analyze the text. […] <ahh>  Then I <r>  will use the Corpus analysis to compare the lexical items used for female gender. Then what is corpus? Corpus refers to a collection of linguistic data, either written text or the transcription of recorded speech. <er> The corpus for the current study consists of the text of two novels and the translation of the Holy Quran. And then for Corpus Analysis, there are different <h> softwares that can be used but I am going to use AntConc software for Corpus Analysis. And after getting findings and results <er> from that software I will interpret the results and those findings. […] These are the novels that I have selected for my study. First, “The Holy Woman” <er> written by “Qaisra Shahraz”. The second one is “Blasphemy” by “Tehmina Durrani” […] Then why I have selected these novels <er> The protagonist in these <er>  novels are female characters and the gender issues have been highlighted in the novels, e.g., education for women, marriage, violence against women, freedom of choice, male superiority, and heritage issues. The backdrop of these novels is Pakistani society. As the religion of the characters is Islam, the novels directly deal with the Muslim Women issues and <er> moreover in these novels, religion has been exploited to support patriarchal culture against female rights. That’s why I have selected these novels. These are few references that I have used in my presentation. These are some of the references of working bibliography. […] Thank you! 
﻿M1: Bismilah… The name is Muhammad Tayyab Kamal. The topic that I have chosen for my research is “From Homeland to Hopeland: A Diasporic Marxist Perspective on Khaled Hosseini’s The Kite Runner and the Mountains Echoed”. The thing that has clicked me for this research is that often we use such topics that meet the identity crisis issues among the diaspore writers and the diaspore literature. <er> I have chosen these texts because there is something that clicked me that is the <er> economic aspects. The characters in these <er> <r> novels have this tendency to <er> adopt anywhere such as such thing has been portrayed in these novels like the this <h> the term <er> transcedental homelessness is given by this very fight by Jaw Boogacks and according to this very concept, <er> character can be at home anywhere in the world. This idea is foregrounded in two of his books. In the first book “Sole and Form”, Jol Boogacks tells us that <er> “human sole is something that had been detached or lost his privilege its privileged position. And then yearns to achieve that”. And in this very <er> theory of the novel book in which <er> he has this he does <r> this analysis of the <h> Stopskeys’ novels. He gaves us this idea <r> of trancedental homelessness in which he says that this sole this character has this ability to at home anywhere. Wherever the <er> body the soul goes because the actual position has been lost in order to achieve that position in order to complete itself it yearns <er> or struggles to achieve that thing back. So this is the basically the concept of trancedental homelessness. This is what the characters are doing in these texts. In this very research I am discussing or highlighting the economic aspects and since the cultural aspects can not be <er> neglected So I am keeping them on the second <er> like level. And my strategy would be that <er> in this research I would start with the <r> this homelessness thing I’ll be telling about the <er> how these characters are homeless and what they do in order to achieve this very thing. And then there will be this <er> From Homeland to Hopeland, this is about their movement from their native land to their […] hopeland which we can call the west as has been portrayed by <er> Khaled Hosseini in her novels. Now this space that from and to, is given in this very space I can discuss the relationship that these characters develop with their <h> hopeland. There <er> we <r> can say host culture. There are two types of things that are highlighted that come across that we come across in these novels. First is there are two generations that are present, the older generation and the younger generation. The older generation, though they migrate to west, still they have this nostalgic affiliation with their land with their <er> homeland. On the other hand, the new generation completely assimilates with the host culture. So in order to discuss both of the aspects I have use thus with the concept of ambivalence given by Homi Baba, in which he says that these <er> <h> in <r> which these characters will have the attraction and repulsion at the same time for the host culture. Attraction on part of the <er> younger generation and repulsion or you we can say nostalgic, rather the nostalgic tendency of the older generation towards the native land. […] After <er> discussing this relationship I’ll come to the writer and as I was saying before that is, writer has tried to advocate this very <er> < h > this <r> very conception that <er> west is the ultimate home for the diaspora people <er> for this there is <er> this researcher, Anthony Apiya, he <h> in his article in the post <er> <h> is the post <h> is postmodern <h> in the  post-modernism, the post in post-colonial, in this article he tells us about the concept of comprador intellectuals. The comprador intellectuals are actually the western style western taught intellectuals, who mediate for the global this capitalism and that very issue is being highlighted in this text because so I’ll be associating this concept of comprador intellectual in Khaled Hosseini as well. So not only I’ll be discussing the migration and the relationship of migrants with their <er> host culture, I’ll also be <er> discussing <er> this stance of the writer the comprador intellectual stance that he adopts for these writers. 
﻿M1: Bismillah. The topic of my M.Phil research is “Syntactic Analysis of Classroom Discourse”. […] <er> now this topic <er> the terms that I’m going to introduce is minimalism. What minimalism is. According to Noam Chomsky, “minimalism is an attempt to ask not only what the properties of language are but why they are that way”. […] Minimalist program is a collection of four articles presented by Noam Chomsky. In these four articles, the first one is the theory of principles and parameters. Second is some notes on economy of Derivation and representation. Third is, a minimalist program for linguistic […] theory. Fourth is categories and transformations. […] I’ll look for minimalist program. In minimalist program, null constituent, we also call it empty categories, have grammatical and semantic features but lack audible phonetic feature-silent or inaudible. Constituent means syntactic units. Wh-movement where the word like what or who <er> moves from the original place. Head-movement, the movement of head word within a phrase. Statement of the problem is <er> written syntax has been researched from minimalistic approach but limited research have been done in spoken syntax. Syntactic structures of Pakistani English teachers at university level have not been analyzed from minimalistic approach. This research is aimed to analyze syntactic structures of those lectures which are being delivered at post graduate level […]. Research objectives, to find null constituent in syntactic structure of of English lectures delivered for post graduate level. To identify the wh-movement in recorded English lectures for post graduate level. To investigate Head Movement in English lectures at phrasal level. Research question, which null constituents do Pakistani English teachers employ […] in classroom discourse at post graduate level? How do English teachers position ‘wh’ in academic discourse at post graduate level? How does Head-movement influence different phrases in academic discourse at post graduate level? Significance of the study would be, <er> the study seeks to explore the syntactic structure of academic discourse at post graduate level. As it is obvious that syntax is the important element of core linguistics which needs to be explored and analyzed. Therefore, this research is aimed to explore the level of English teachers syntactic structures. This study will help the students, teachers, researchers, syntacticians and academic discourse community to know more about the parameters or categories in English lectures delivered at university level. […] Delimitation of the study, my study will be delimited […] the present study is limited to the syntactic structures used at post graduate level (BS <h> English classes). The data will be collected from three different universities of Pakistan that includes, Air University Islamabad, International Islamic University Islamabad, NUML Islamabad. […] Research methodology. Research Design. The study is based on mixed method where the data will be analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. In qualitative method I shall analyze the syntactic patterns of the recorded English lectures from the four universities. The frequency of syntactic patterns will be analyzed quantitatively. […] Theoretical framework. Minimalist program <er> Noam Chomsky, 1995. To investigate the minimal unit of a sentence. In this framework, I’ll be going for […] to find out these <r> constituents in my research. Null constituent. In null constituents, null subjects. […] Non-finite null subject for instance, we don’t want anyone to upset them. We don’t want, […] anyone is null here, it is a null constituent. We don’t want to upset them. Finite null subject. Imperative null subject means intrinsically second […] person. Truncated null subject. Shortened, i.e., we <h> <r> I can’t come. <r> Null auxiliaries. Null T in auxiliaries final clauses. He enjoys syntax. He enjoyed syntax. Number first He does enjoy syntax. Here T (tense) is null in auxiliary […] less. And the second He enjoyed syntax. He did enjoy syntax. […] Tense is null here and auxiliary less. Null T in bare infinitive clauses. I have never known (Tom criticize anyone). T (tense) is null and bare infinitive. Without infinitive. The correct would be like, I have never known Tom to criticize anyone. Null C in finite clauses. We didn’t know (if he had resigned). We didn’t know (that he had resigned). ‘If’ and ‘that’ C <i> are null here. We didn’t know (he had resigned). […] Null C in non-finite clauses. Null determiners and quantifiers. We linguists. John, is without […] determiner. We can add ‘the John’ or within it a determiner here. Wh-movement and Head-movement. Data collection. Data would be collected through audio device. Every lecture would be recorded in form of audio recording. The lectures would be collected from English department of selected universities through convenience sampling. Population and sampling. 15 lectures from male teachers and 15 female teachers. Air University, ten lectures. International Islamic […] University Islamabad, ten lectures. NUML Islamabad, ten lectures. Total, thirty lectures. Data Analysis. I’ll analyze my data <er> by using parsing or tree diagram. 

﻿M1: Bismilah… Aslam O Alikum and good afternoon everyone. <er> The topic of this presentation is “Condemnation of War and Terror in Contemporary Pakistani Fiction: Identifying Appraisal in the Text”. So the outline of this study. <er> First I will introduce the topic then the data for the study, research questions, objectives, methodology and finally theoretical framework. Coming towards the introduction of this topic. The present technological advancements and scientific discoveries has also brought some serious evils. These been spread to every corner of the world. Specifically the incident of 9/ 11 pushed the world into a war where peace has become a distant dream. This war has unleashed so many terrorists networks. So as a result all the written material whether they are film industry, short stories and other novels, they have fallen prey of this warlike atmosphere. […] Continuing the introduction, <c> Ramanan says that if the world changed after the incident of 9/ 11, literature also changed. So this statement clearly shows the impact of 9/ 11 and other subsequent attacks on the literature of this time. […] Different writers narrated these terrorists events from multi dimensions. As the title of this topic suggests that <c> <er> writers have condemned and they have shown certain resistance to violence acts which is <er> continued in the history throughout in the history of literature. We we can see that the writers have never endorsed the violence acts which can endanger human life but they have shown their resistance and they have shown their love for humanity like <h> from the Punjabi poets, we can say that Habib Jalib,  Mureed Niazi they have taken such a <er>  duty. In the English literature we can quote this area. <c> Again Eliot depicts the <er> impacts of World War first in his poetry. He wrote Wasteland to describe the modern world as a wasteland where the land is immortal. In The Hollow Men he again tell the emptiness of religion and society and even life after post war period. He described <h> his poetry that war has contaminated all aspects of society. So this study is also an attempt to see how Pakistani authors have portrayed violence and extremism in their works. <c> The data for this study of two novels that have been selected from a correction to random sampling. The Scatter here is too Great by Bilal Tanveer. <er> This novel published in 2013 and offers an insight into urban Pakistan Karachi <er> at a time when it is engulfed by violence and extremism. One Karachi afternoon is caused on people crowd to (opposite) street. A bomb explode. Nothing will be the same for the new stone award by this ugly war. So here the writer Bilal Tanveer reveals the pain and loneliness and tragedies of these people. <er> The next work is of Nadeem Aslam The Blind Man’s Garden that starts in the aftermath of 9/ 11 and takes place largely in Pakistan. This is the story of two brothers Joe and Mikal. They are from the Village (Heath) from the Punjab province of Pakistan. <er> They went secretly to Afghanistan at the time when the when the tensions were intensified between the <hmm> Afghan Afghani Taliban and the American soldiers. So, <er> through the perspective of these two characters the writer have showed that how war and how violence <er>   have targeted in <er> <h>  <r> the innocence of the society. And this study lies under the umbrella term of critical terrorism studies. As we know after 9/ 11 terrorism studies have gone under a major transformation. And this <er> this <r> approach <er> studies the issues of terrorism from a critical perspective. And it is <er> it challenges the <er> weakness and the <er> orthodox terrorism studies based on rigorous empirical findings. The research questions of this study is <h> are that, how the phenomena of terrorism and violence portrayed in the contemporary Pakistan fiction? What extense the rising tides of extremism linked to the various shades of resistance? How the writer have shown the resistant to certain violent acts and what extent? How the character’s responses are being evaluated and how far do the writers convey their emotions, pity and fear? This again the most important part of this study because as we know in the post-war community the emotions of <er> disappointment get <er> prevailing. So this again the same thing. Objectives, to highlight the impact of rising terrorism on the <er> politics and the education system of the country to establish a new parameter to define the concept of terrorism and its reflections in the novel. Terrorism is <er> again is a debatable issue. So <er> this study will give us the picture <er> the whole picture of terrorism that <er> who are the terrorist in the <er> writer’s perspective. And to disclose the enormous strength of pen and the writer’s critique on the subject matter. How the writer have shown resistance. <h> Significance of this study this contribute <er> this study will contribute to the terrorism studies with new intellectual talents. And it offers an insight into the nature of literary practices. And is gets the researcher to undertake studies in different contexts. For example, they can <er> they can describes the <r> resistance shown by the poets or other type of genre. The main purpose of this study is to <er> is to describe the mental attitude of the novelist <er> whether the writers have portrayed negatively or positively the victims of the war. So this again stance the mental attitude of the writer. The methodology of this study. It is descriptive in nature. And it implies both qualitative and quantitative methods, […] supports the arguments through textually culled evidence and it uses appraisal for analyzing evaluation and stance in a text. Appraisal is a framework an from sustaining functional linguistics which is developed in 1990 by <er> Martin and now it is used in social sciences research worldwide. Appraisal is used for textual analysis of a text. <er> it will <er> <r> be familiar to that <h> students who have studied discourse in discipline. So appraisal is used for analyzing evaluation so what is evaluation in the SFL language. Evaluation is that how the speaker or writer takes either a positive or negative views of the participants, actions or state of fears. So this is evaluations. And the stance, what is the mental attitude of the writer towards certain phenomena in a text. […] So appraisal. <er> from this framework I will <er> take three things, three language phenomenas. Attitude, engagement and graduation. Attitude means human emotional reactions expressed in discourse. How the writer have shown the emotions, <er> the emotional responses of the characters. And engagement when the writer creating <h> spaces for otherwises and he includes certain other characters in his narrative. Graduation means when the writers uses words in order to increase the intensity of certain utterances. I will give example at the end. <c> Like for example I have <er> these are the examples from the novels. Attitude, like “angry killers” tell us explicitly the emotional state of the killers. This lies under the <er> attitude for the <er> framework. Graduation for example here <er> general example, the educational system places “too” much emphasis on the grades and less on integrity. So this is graduation here the writer used “too” in order to increase the intensity of the utterance. As the title of the study suggest condemnation. For example, the writer have <er> shown <er> the <er> used certain words for example deadly bomb blast, ugly war. This is again graduations. This is an example from the novels The Scatters here is too Great. A lover with his beloved driving to a sea for entertainment, and suddenly on the way the <r> blast went off as a result everything scattered and the windscreen of the car is smashed by a strayed bullet. So here the writer <er> <r> have described the emotional state and <er> as a response to this blast. The character says “Why I have to deal with this? I don’t deserve what a damn hell.” So <h> <er> this I “why I have to deal with this?” and here it is used again “I don’t deserve”. So it is <er> the voice of the <er> of the writer. The writer associate himself with the perception <er> <er> of the speaker. Here he <r> sponsor <er> here he supports the arguments of the speaker. And it reveals the pain and emotions at the time of incident. So this is the end of the slide. 

﻿M1: Aslam o Alikum Everyone! Before starting my presentation I would like to thank you all for being here for attending my presentation. […] <er>  The topic of my research which I am going to conduct is “A Corpus Based Study of Evidentiality in Selected Pakistani and British Newspaper Editorials”. <c> So everyone knows that corpus is the collection of text. It can be written or spoken <c> and the <er> it is in machine readable form for example, if you want to analyze a corpus you compile a corpus and then you have softwares like AntConc and you can use that to you know count the frequency, to count the frequency how many times a particular <h> word or linguistic expression occurs and what is the function of that marker. That is why the main advantage of this study is that you can you know study <er> <h> you can analyze a huge corpus in you know limit it in a short time. <c> And there is also such implications in <h> classroom like in corpus you <er> <r> also <er> study words in context that this words occurs with that words and that collocates that words. Now […] coming towards evidentiality as this word is self-explanatory evidentiality means evidence. Have you an evidence for something for affect you know making <h> information you are imparting arguing. Have you any sort of evidence? What is the source of that information? That is called evidentiality. And you know every time for persuasive writing, evidentiality plays a vital role because it does not only provide background information but also strengthen <r> your arguments. That is why the study of evidentiality….. < int: M2: what do you mean by it? Can you give an example> For example, if I say that according to Panama, “a particular politician is the most corrupt person in the world”. According to Panama, this is the source. This is the evidence I have. < int: M2: Do you know that evidentiality is grammatically encoded or there are strategies to express evidentiality?> In some languages like Quincha and Tuba and other languages it is grammatically expressed. There are some glatics prefixes and suffixes. < int: M2: And what are the four types of evidentiality?>  Four types? So every writer has <er> you know <er> provide some <er> <int: F1:  presentation <er> ap slides agy chlo na ap <er>. 	M	2: vo agy ja hi ni rha. <L> <i>> This is the overview of my presentation. <er> I will first introduce the terms like evidentiality. What is evidentiality? What are editorials? And then I will present my questions like what the study aims to you know <er> to find the answers for and then why this study has significance. Why is this study significant? And then I would <er> review some literature on that topic and then I would talk about research methodology. What type of methodology I am going to employ for the current study or what kind of theoretical framework am I going to employ for the current study. […] Now editorial, coming towards editorial. If you know the newspaper, there are various sections like there might be a <h> national section, international section and editorial section. The National section just only provide facts that what is happening in the <h> in the country. For example, the DAWN newspaper, it would you know provide you the fact that these events are taking place in Pakistan. International type of <er>, international <er> <r> <c> you know international what is happening in the world? The report would be about but what is editorial. The most interesting section of the newspaper is editorial because it is <er> the mixture of both facts and opinions. It does not only provide facts that what is happening but also you know <h> but also <er> <r> provide you the newspaper comments on those particular events. The point of view of the editorial is <h> of the newspaper is presented in the editorial. <c> Now types of editorial. Bell classified editorials into attacks, criticism, defense and praise. Editorial deals with many kind of subject, subject matter. For example, < int: M2: what is the difference between attack and criticism?> What is the difference between attack and criticism? Attack is the severe form of <h> criticism. <Int: M2: severe form of> <er> criticism. For example, if you want to criticize <er> a politician, so you can write about that in <er> editorial section that why you <er> criticize him. For example, if I say that according to Panama League, “he is the most corrupt <er> politician” that is why. Now coming toward the definition of evidentiality. According to Aikhenvald, “Evidentiality is linguistic category whose primary meaning is source of information”. The information you are giving is, what is the source? From where you come to know about that specific information you are impart <er> giving it to the reader? […] Now Corniclie classified evidential markers into the following groups. He first…<er> there is one type is direct. The person who is imparting <r> or giving information has witnessed the action. For example, if I say that he is a thief. So the <h> listener would obviously want you to do <h> to give him some evidence that why you say that a particular person is a thief. I would say that I have seen him in a shop you know, he <r> he’s stolen some money from the shopkeeper. That is visual type of evidentiality. And you it is direct type of evidentiality. Indirect includes inferentials. For example, you have no evidence but <er> you have no source but you know but there are some tangible evidence and on those tangible evidence, you give them information. For example, you say that the dog must be in pain. Now ‘must’ performs two functions, the first <er> function is evidential <er> evidential and the second is modality. For example, you see a dog and it is whimpering and it is making <er> sad voices and there is a cut on his face and there is blood you can make the inference that the dog must be in pain. Where the evidence come from? You make an inference so ‘must’ here perform […] the <er> you know the function of evidentiality. […] Now <c> when you are realizing evidentiality you have to take into account, attribution and evidence. For example, an attribute statement is that which contains a reference to the source of information. And in non-fictional texts like newspaper the statement or the information as attributed to someone else. <c> He said the politician is corrupt. Now he said, the source is ‘he’. It is ‘he’ who give you <er> the information that the politician is corrupt. And there are also <er> evidence like you <r> show your own <h>, interpretation if I say the part, a survey showed, a survey criticized, a report criticized, it means that you are giving you own […] interpretation of that survey or that report. So these type of word should also be analyzed when you are working, analyzing evidentiality because it comes with the source like he criticized, ‘he’ is the source of information and ‘criticizes’ is […] <h> the verb or the attributed verb. […] Now there are two views on evidentiality. One is narrow view of evidentiality. <c> Chafe said that when you are analyzing and adopting a narrow view, you are just analyzing the source of information that from where <er> the information comes. But when you are analyzing it from a broad view you do not only analyze <er> the source but also the attitude of the speaker towards that information what is his opinion about that information. He may qualify his information like some <er> modal expressions like probably and may be things like that. […] So according to Chafe he express <int : F1: <i>> These are the research questions which <er> I am going <er>  which the researcher would attend to answer. What are the evidential markers employed by Pakistani and British editorial writers? Is there any significant difference in terms of occurrence and function of evidential markers in Pakistani and British newspaper editorials? What is the role of evidentiality in strengthening the argumentative structure of the editorials? So this question is very important you know whenever you are analyzing <er> argumentative text you have <er> to know that what is the rule of evidentiality and strengthening the argumentative structure of that editorial. […] The study would contribute to media discourse <int: M2: next please.> Now there is a study on evidentiality in which Soukohi, Norwood and Soltani studied evidentiality evidentials in Persian newspaper editorials and found that an evidential is employed in these columns for not only presenting factual information but also you know <er> as “supportive instrument in order to increase persuasive power of the text”. […] There is the research methodology. The current study employs both qualitative and quantitative approaches. <er> The frequency counts that how many times a particular evidential marker occurs in a textual decounted and the function they perform would be qualitatively analyzed. <int : F2: <er> tahir where is the future tense here? […] the study will employ, you are proposing, use the future tense, the study will employ. > <er> Now there is the population sample. Four newspapers are selected <int: M2: four newspaper? > for the current study. Two newspaper, <er> two British and two Pakistani newspaper would be selected <int: M2: two from the same <i>> <er> I would follow simple sample technique. <int : F2: Explain, how would you select? > For example, if you open the website of that newspaper and you go to the section of editorials it would open the <er>  the daily you know the <er> date is mentioned that on this date three editorials are published so the same date the editorials which appear on the same date will be selected for the study. <int: M2: twenty five.> Twenty five from each newspaper. Twenty five and four two are Pakistani and < int : F2: you have four newspaper, two from Pakistan two from Britain. And twenty five from each newspaper> and 25 from each newspaper 2015 and 2016 the time period. There is the theoretical framework. For example, if the source is the identified individual, I would mark it like the person or the source come comes from the person so <er> h so. information comes from a person and a person is explicitly mentioned. If the person is not mentioned like someone has said then it would be marked as individual unidentified. If a an information comes from a government body, a particular survey or report, it would be deemed as an institutional identified or specified source and when the source is concede then it would be deemed at deemed as institutional uniden…identi…unidentified or unspecified source. (these are based on some work or you are identifying this?) yes, this is based on some work. (Then quote the reference). Now whenever you are presenting information you may not know that how reliable the information is. If you are analyzing from a broad view you have to take into account the epistemic modality like may, might, may be, probably, certainly, possibly, surely, perhaps. So these type of evidential expressions would be also analyzed. 
﻿F1: My name is Maria Sani and my supervisor is Dr. Inayat Ullah. Today I’m here for my synopsis defense’ presentation and the topic of my research is “A Comparative Study of Linguistic Tropes in Raja Gidh and A God in Every Stone”. […] <er> Meaning and language comes about through style or the linguistic choices that a writer makes either consciously or unconsciously. And this style vary according to different factors such as genre, <er> context, historical period or the author. <er> Analyzing language of a text according to Gilles systematically looking at the formal features of the text and <h> that determining the functional significance for interpreting of text for <i> So while analyzing the language stylistic analysis helps us in, helps us in better understanding the similarities and differences in different languages. So this <er> stylistic <er> study is different in literature and linguistic. When we <er> say that it is <er> <r> literary stylistics so literary stylistics basically focuses only on the artistic effects and when it comes to linguistic stylistics, <er> in linguistic stylistics there is a focus on the study of language and <er> the creativity of <er> language in different texts. So, <er> as we all know that language has its particular way of writing and expressing different things. So whenever we need a (test) in any language we, <er> <r> come across different tropes and <er> these tropes are sometimes similar in different languages which we call as universal tropes. As stylistic analysis helps us in understanding these tropes which <er> which operate in the written text as these are all the effects achieved through the language and though the building of (provident) linguistic structures. <er> so each trope gives rise to its own mental spaces and each mental space is according to the Gilles Fauconnier’s are the conceptual <er> <r> packets and <er> these <er> and these mental spaces are internally structured by the frames and cognitive models by so and <er> and externally also known as connectors that relate mental spaces to one another. And whenever <er> and <er> and this theory of mental spaces <er> is proposed by Gilles Fauconnier and <er> his <er> and his theory is ‘Mental Space Theory’. <er> And on the basis of this mental space theory, <er> if speakers <er> if Urdu speakers read <er> any kind of <er> English trope in a text whose cognate is there in Urdu language then <er> they only need to link English trope with Urdu trope. And I will explain this concept later on. So, […] <er> my statement of problem is <er> Readers while reading the text in second or foreign language often face difficulty in understanding the real message. And <er> second language readers are sometimes unable to create mental spaces for tropes used in second language. The problem of interpreting these tropes lie in the necessity to render their figurative meaning while maintaining the same imagery of the original. My research objectives are to analyze English and Urdu tropes in the <h> in the hope to find out the degree to which they are comparable or diverse. And my second research <h> objective is to investigate the importance of tropes in meaning construction. On the basis of my research objectives, my research questions are What are the similarities and differences in the usage of English and Urdu tropes? And my second research question is how tropes helpful in the construction of meaning through mental spaces? Significance of my study is to bring to light some areas of cognitive research which have received less attention, and also the figurative <h> figurative language so that the readers will get the whole idea, the real message or what actually the writer wants to convey through the use of tropes through the use of figurative language. This research study will enrich the study of tropes and hopefully it will <er>  it will be used as reference for those who are interested in <r> figurative language analysis in <er> linguistic stylistics analysis. It will also improve knowledge of readers especially in comparing linguistic features of different languages. Delimitation of the study is that it is delimited to only focusing on the four tropes and these four trope are the <er> are the master tropes <er> proposed by Kenneth Burke <er> and these four master tropes are metaphor, metonymy, irony and synecdoche and the two novel are A God in Every Stone and Raja Gidh taken from <er> taken one from each language. Raja Gidh is Urdu and A God in Every Stone is English. […] <er> by doing literature review figurative language according to Rosa and <er>  and Eschholz is the language used in a creative rather than a literal sense. <er> They basically proposed the <er> the <h> <er> the <er> that figurative language is used mostly in <er> in <h> <er> creative writings and <er> their focus was on creativity and <er> the <er> and <er> <r> creative language. And the second literature reviews of the <er> <r> Kovecses that claims that there is an equal focus on the importance of metaphorical language not only in the English language but in many other languages of the world. They proposed that this figurative language and this use of tropes is not only in English language but in different language of the world. And <er> when I was reviewing literature I came across <er> this <r> book which is in Urdu <r> k Asaleeb e Bayan by Dr. Muhe Addin <h> Qadri Zoor. And <er> he <r> compared Urdu stylistics and <er> English stylistics, style of Urdu and English writers in <er>  in his book and this book is on the Asloob and Asaleeb. […] So my methodology is that it is a qualitative research. The tools selected for <er> for this research are constant interpretation of data from beginning to the end and side by side I will compare <er> that data. And my data sample is one novel <er> from Urdu Raja Gidh which is by Bano Qudsia and second novel is in English which is A God in Every Stone by Kamila Shamsie and the data will be qualitatively collected and analyzed on the basis of comparative analysis that the that how the data is similar or diverse in two languages. I basically used two theoretical frameworks one is <h> Keneth Burke’s “Four Master Trope’s” theory which was published in 1941 and <er> his four master tropes are metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche and irony. And second one and the second theoretical framework is “Mental Space Theory” developed by Fauconnier in his book <er> Mental Spaces: Aspects of meaning Construction in <er> in Natural Language. And he proposed this Mental Space Theory that how the cognates are working that how these mental spaces are the conceptual packets. <er> So the <er> four master Tropes are metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche and irony. Metaphor is the comparison made by referring to <er> one thing <er> as another like we can say that <er> like Kamila Shamsie said in his book that she was <er> <h> was a spinster <er> at the age of forty so he used a metaphor of spinster for <i> so <er> these kind of metaphors are also there in Urdu language which I will <er> study <er> in Raha Gidh. And then Metonymy, metonymy is the reference to something or someone by naming one of it its attributes. <er> Like if are <er> discussing <er> U.S. president and we say that <er> White House at risk <i> so we are basically talking about the U.S. president <er> but we are not using his name or his attribute but <er> we are saying that White House is <i> And then third one is synocdoche which is a <er> whole is represented by name of  <er>  of one of its parts like if I say that  <er> the whole world is against me so it’s not like <er>  the whole world is against me but <er>  some of the people are but I’m saying that the whole world is against me so it is an example of synecdoche. And then irony, irony is speaking in such a way as to imply the contrary of what one says, often for the purpose <er> of derision, mockery, or jest. It is <er> like if we are talking about the bad times and we are saying that nowadays <er> <r> I feel sick of time. So this is kind of irony. […] Then Mental Space Theory, this Mental Space Theory is proposed by Fauconnier, describing meaning construction through through ‘Mental Space Theory’ in his book Mental Spaces: Aspects of Meaning Construction in Natural Languages. During meaning construction, mental spaces linked to one another in various ways, allowing readers to ‘link back’ mental spaces constructed earlier <er> in the thought process. Mental spaces according to Fauconnier are internally structured by frames and cognitive models and externally are linked by so-called connectors that relate mental spaces to one another. And <er> if the readers are <er> are reading <er> if Urdu speakers are reading in English language and they come across <er>  different words which are there in English language relating back to their own <er> <r> first language and then they relate cognates of the English language with cognates of Urdu language. So this is how the Mental Space Theory which was proposed by Fauconnier. And the data analysis, the approach for the data analysis would be “thematic approach” which is the most adequate way to reveal similarities, differences and contradictions involved in certain definitions to reveal the aspects that determine the analysis of a trope. Basically <er> my study is not the context-based study where we are top focusing on the historical background and on the other things. My study is only the textual study where I am only focusing on the text and the language used in <er> those texts. So data will be collected in two ways. <er> Urdu data will be collected manually and English data will be collected through corpus techniques through using <er> <r> the AntConc corpus.  So these are some of the references which I used. Thank you!
